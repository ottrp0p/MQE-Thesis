### File Descriptions ###


### NOTE THAT DIRECTORIES IN THE FILES WERE WRITTEN AS ABSOLUTE AND NOT LOCAL ###
### YOU WILL HAVE TO CHANGE DIRECTORIES AS NECESSARY TO RUN ON OTHER MACHINES ###

1. Report

Folder of files related to the compiling of LaTeX files to generate Capstone.pdf

2. 0 

This folder is the 0th part of the KDD cup 2003 dataset that contains arXiv latex source files. 

3. TestBatch, TestBatch1

These folders as name imply are test batches of LaTeX source files used to develop the cleaning files. 

4. latexclean.py

The first code written. Developed on the arXiv dataset. Currently the code is running on TestBatch1 and its output folder. 
It cleans up latex files, performs LSA/SVD, and then defines the similarity measure function. 

5. econbiz.py 

iterates through EconBiz records to find usable PDFs. Saves PDFs and corresponding metadata. They are named by their EconBiz article ID. 

6. econbiz

folder that contains pdfs (after running econbiz.py), contains a folder of metadata (after running econbiz.py), contains txt files (after running convert.sh to generate txts off of pdfs), contains a folder of cleanfiles (after running econobiztxtclean.py). 

7. convert.sh 

Code to be run in commandline to batch convert the EconBiz PDFs into text files. 

8. econbiztxtclean.py

Cleans, runs LSA/SVD, and defines similarity measure for the EconBiz dataset. Takes in the text files generated by convert.sh on the set of pdfs. 

9. econbizdf.csv 

This is the feature document space used for similarity comparisons (Sigma * V^t). This was saved from the pandas df created in econbiztxtclean.py. Note that the first column is the index, so specify that col 0 is the index when loading with pandas. 

10. Recommend.py 

The nicely wrapped finished version for EconBiz. Runs a user-friendly recommendation system with prompted options. Requires the feature vs document matrix in econbizdf.csv
